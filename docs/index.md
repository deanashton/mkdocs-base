## About the software

Every child is entitled to achieve their potential and make good progress relative to their prior attainment.
 
Target Tracker allows EYFS, Key Stage 1 and 2 schools  to effectively manage, record and analyse assessments.

A whole school system, it allows the user to look at data for a single pupil, the entire school or anything in between.  Head Teachers are able to quickly and easily access and analyse assessments and save admin staff time when updating systems and creating statutory assessment data returns.

It has been designed to offer unparalleled ease of use combined with market leading levels of powerful, useful data analysis.

Target Tracker is developed and supported by Essex Local Authority ensuring a close link to the schools using the software. Originally an Essex only product Primary Target tracker now has a wide user base across England and throughout the world totalling over 3500 schools.
